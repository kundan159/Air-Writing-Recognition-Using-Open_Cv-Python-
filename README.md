# Air Writing Recognition Using Open_Cv(Python)
 Air writing recognition, facilitated by color detection and tracking using OpenCV in Python, offers a compelling method for intuitive human-computer interaction. This paper presents an enhanced approach where a colored marker attached to the fingertip serves as the input device. The system detects the marker's color, generates a corresponding mask, and applies morphological operations like erosion and dilation to refine the mask.. Air-writing refers Colour Detection and tracking is used in order to achieve the objective. The colour marker in detected and a mask is produced. Ever wanted to draw your imagination by just waiving your finger or object in air. Here a coloured object at tip of finger or object is used as the marker.
